# MIN, MAX, SUM, and AVG are known as Aggregate Functions. COUNT is another example of an aggregate function.

# Aggregate Functions combine multiple rows of data into a single value.

# Aggregate Functions are usually used with GROUP BY statements (and that is where they show their true power), but it's not necessary.



#1. AVG Example:
- Table Name: NumbersTable

Id | Number
-----------
01 | 5.00000
02 | 5.00000
03 | 5.00000
04 | 5.00000

SELECT AVG(Number) FROM NumbersTable
- Returns -> Avg Number = 5.00000



#2. ROUND Example (use table in #1 as example):
ROUND(Value you want to round, number of decimal places you want to round to)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(Number), 2) FROM NumbersTable
- If value returned was 5.00000, this function would allow you to return 5.00



#3. MIN Example:
- Table Name: NumbersVaryTable

Id | Number
-----------
01 | 1
02 | 2
03 | 3
04 | 4

SELECT MIN(Number) FROM NumbersVaryTable
- Returns -> 1



#4. MAX Example (use table in #3 as example):
SELECT MAX(Number) FROM NumbersVaryTable
- Returns -> 4



#5. SUM Example (use table in #3 as example):
SELECT SUM(Number) FROM NumbersVaryTable
- Returns -> 10
